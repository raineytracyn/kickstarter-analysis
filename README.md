# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
##### Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Category Comparison
### The results of the graph below show you that Music and Theather did very well! The question is how and why? How do we define "very well"?

## Subcategory Comparison
### The results of the graph below show you that Tabletop games, Photobooks and Hardware did very well! Same question, the question is how and why? How do we define "very well"? As you continue reading, this will provide you one perspective of how and why those categories are considered to have done "very well", and if we missed any!

## Launch Date Comparison
### Launch dates were very interesting! May and June were the most successful! You can see September and December were the least successful, and that January, July, and October had the greatest Failures. Could this be corrolated to holiday time frames? Lets continue.....

## Descriptive Statistics
### Let's go a little further in depth! When you look at the Box and Whisker Plot, you can see 25% of the Kickstarter campaigns for musicals in Great Britain got 0 funding! You can see the median and mode are faily close for Pledged relative to Goals. This tells you the data is symmetic, where as the data shown for Goals is faily skewed due to mean being nearly double what the median is.

## Summary Question
### Is the length of a campaign correlated with its success?
#### When we combine Outcomes, and break down the lengths of time, we find the majority fall within 26 to 30 days
##### ![Combined Outcomes by Length](https://github.com/raineytracyn/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Combined%20Outcomes%20by%20Length%20of%20Time.png)
#### Lets take a closer look, and analyze Success and Failed. Looking at both, you can again see both fall within 26 to 30 days.
##### ![Number of Success Outcomes by Length of Time](https://github.com/raineytracyn/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Number%20of%20Success%20Outcomes%20by%20Length%20of%20Time.png)
##### ![Number of Failed Outcomes by Length of Time](https://github.com/raineytracyn/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Number%20of%20Failed%20Outcomes%20by%20Length%20of%20Time.png)
#### Lets dive a bit deeper; you can see breaking it down by a few days, that the 30 day period has the greatest number of success outcomes. At the same time, the 30 day period also has the greatest number of failed outcomes. What we were able to learn is that a 30 day long kickstarter did much better than any of length of time (which ranged from 1 to 90 days). While this does indicate time frame does have an impact on the outcome, it does not demonstrate itself as a key factor.
##### ![Number of Failed Outcomes by Length of Time](https://github.com/raineytracyn/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Number%20of%20Success%20and%20Failed%20by%20Length%20of%20Time.png)
### What are the top three Parent Categories that had success with a 30 day campaign?
#### Now that we know 30 days had the greatest success of all lengths, we can now look at which Parent Categories did well with a 30 day campaign. As you can see below, that would be Theater, Music, and Film & Video.

## Next Steps
### Now that the top three "sucessful Parent Categories by Length of Days" has been establish, we can deep dive into finding what other areas of similarities they have. Once identified, we can look to see if other Parent Categories have the correlations, which will help identify what components likely led to their failed outcome.
