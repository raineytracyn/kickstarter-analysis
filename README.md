# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
##### Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Category Comparison
### The results of the graph below show you that Music and Theather did very well! The question is how and why? How do we define "very well"?

## Subcategory Comparison
### The results of the graph below show you that Tabletop games, Photobooks and Hardware did very well! Same question, the question is how and why? How do we define "very well"? As you continue reading, this will provide you one perspective of how and why those categories are considered to have done "very well", and if we missed any!

## Launch Date Comparison
### Launch dates were very interesting! May and June were the most successful! You can see September and December were the least successful, and that January, July, and October had the greatest Failures. Could this be corrolated to holiday time frames? Lets continue.....

## Descriptive Statistics
### Let's go a little further in depth! When you look at the Box and Whisker Plot, you can see 25% of the Kickstarter campaigns for musicals in Great Britain got 0 funding! You can see the median and mode are faily close for Pledged relative to Goals. This tells you the data is symmetic, where as the data shown for Goals is faily skewed due to mean being nearly double what the median is.

## Goals
### How well did the Parent Categories do in meeting their goal?
#### This was truly an amazing outcome! For parent categories which had a successful outcome, they went well above and beyond! As you can see, Games and Technology exceeded their goals by 292% and 415%! To further dive into the details, we would break this down by country, subcategory and length of compaign as some of these may be higher to two one or two campaigns doing overly well. Anything from timing, climate, culture, or politics could have had an impact on the results.

### In contrast, below shows those whose outcome was failed. One thing to note of interest is that none of the parent categories came close to meeting their goals. All percentages are very low. This would be a great data set to dive into further to learn what similarities they have. Great piece for "lessons learned" going forward.

## Summary Question
### Is the length of a campaign correlated with its success?
#### When we combine Outcomes, and break down the lengths of time, we find the majority fall within 26 to 30 days
##### ![Combined Outcomes by Length](https://github.com/raineytracyn/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Combined%20Outcomes%20by%20Length%20of%20Time.png)
#### Lets take a closer look, and analyze Success and Failed. Looking at both, you can again see both fall within 26 to 30 days.
##### ![Number of Success Outcomes by Length of Time](https://github.com/raineytracyn/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Number%20of%20Success%20Outcomes%20by%20Length%20of%20Time.png)
##### ![Number of Failed Outcomes by Length of Time](https://github.com/raineytracyn/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Number%20of%20Failed%20Outcomes%20by%20Length%20of%20Time.png)
#### Lets dive a bit deeper; you can see breaking it down by a few days, that the 30 day period has the greatest number of success outcomes. At the same time, the 30 day period also has the greatest number of failed outcomes. What we were able to learn is that a 30 day long kickstarter did much better than any of length of time (which ranged from 1 to 90 days). While this does indicate time frame does have an impact on the outcome, it does not demonstrate itself as a key factor.
##### ![Number of Failed Outcomes by Length of Time](https://github.com/raineytracyn/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Number%20of%20Success%20and%20Failed%20by%20Length%20of%20Time.png)
### What are the top three Parent Categories that had success with a 30 day campaign?
#### Now that we know 30 days had the greatest success of all lengths, we can now look at which Parent Categories did well with a 30 day campaign. As you can see below, that would be Theater, Music, and Film & Video. **(An interesting observation is that while those three came out most successful looking at it by "Campaign lengths", they were the lowest of "Successful Outcome Goal Results"!!)**

## Next Steps
### Now that the top three "sucessful Parent Categories by Length of Days" has been establish, we can deep dive into finding what other areas of similarities they have. Once we have a set of "other similar data sets", we can review the remaining compaigns that are <> 30 days to see which also have the identified set of "other similar data sets". The count of "other similar data sets" will tell us which correlate with success outside of Campaign Length.
### Another area to look into is the observation made a litte bit ago; is that while Theater, Misic, and Film & Video came out most successful looking at it by "Campaign lengths", they were the lowest of "Successful Outcome Goal Results". It is important to understand why. Could it be due to skillsets of staff at different stages of the Kickstarter? Maybe there was a holiday during the campaign? Did it start on a weekday or weekend, or payday? These are all areas that can be looked into further.
